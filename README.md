# Bloggit

This is a full-stack MERN application that allows users to view and leave comments on published blog posts on [Bloggit View](https://sheacronin.github.io/blog-viewing) and author and manage their own blog posts on [Bloggit Author](https://sheacronin.github.io/blog-authoring).

The user must make an account through the signup page to author blog posts or leave comments.
